The check for Store #27246 is sent one day later and alway takes more than one week to clear our bank. Earlier today I sent a response regarding this payment. It was Check #6899 for Inv. 127308345 and 227178501. The total of the check was $1984.43. It was mailed to you on 3/25/19. There is no way you don't have it. Again, this happens every week to Store #27246. You never have a problem with the other store. I wonder if someone can't match it up because they are only looking at the account for #26687.",Paid by Customer

"DSN Your message to cleary.51@osu.edu couldn't be delivered. A custom mail flow rule created by an admin at buckeyemail.osu.edu has blocked your message. The e-mail account does not exist at the organization this message was sent to. (NLA13) ABC.customer.credi. . . Office 365 osu.edu Sender Action Required Blocked by mail flow rule How to Fix ItAn email admin at buckeyemail.osu.edu has created a custom mail flow rule that blocks messages that meet certain conditions, and it appears that your message has met one or more of those conditions. Check the text above for a custom message from the email admin that may help explain why your message was blocked and how you might be able to fix it. For example, removing prohibited words from the message or sending the message from a different email account may be sufficient to deliver your message. If you've tried and you're still not able to fix the problem, consider contacting the email admin at buckeyemail.osu.edu to discuss what to do. While they're unlikely to remove or relax the rule, if you have a legitimate need to deliver your message they may offer guidance for how to do so. More Info for Email Admins Status code: 550 5.7.1_ETR This error occurs because an email admin at buckeyemail.osu.edu has created a custom mail flow rule that has blocked the sender's message. In some cases, the sender can change the message so it no longer violates the rule. However, depending on the rule's conditions, it's possible that the only way to deliver the message is to change the rule itself, and only an email admin at buckeyemail.osu.edu can do that. Although it's possible the rule is unintentionally flawed or it's stricter than the admin intended, it may be working exactly as they want it to.

"Ms. Brink, My apologies for the late reply. Last week was a unusually busy week and I did not get to all of my emails. In response to your query, my company has experienced some payment delays in the year of 2019. We took on a new bookkeeping system which has proven to be challenging for the company and has made slow progress. The company is still processing checks once per month at this point. I have looked over the invoices on our account and they are for March and April. They have all been turned in to the company for proper check processing. We do ask for just a bit of patience as they work this out as I am sure that it will not take much longer to get this working in a much more proficient manner of processing checks again twice per month which will completely satisfy your 3 week payment schedule. As soon as the Payment for all of the March invoices are processed in the next couple of days I will be more that glad to forward you check numbers and amounts with expected check arrival dates which will bring us current. I am most positive that within the next month or two this will cease to be of issue.

I have been in touch with kylee our rep. I have been mailing our checks because I had three there and she wasn't picking them up. Unfortunately I have been mailing them to the Indianapolis address because no one informed me the billing center had moved. What I'm not clear on is why they aren't forwarding the checks or that no one from there let me know or sent the checks back. I'm waiting on kylee to find out where my checks are. I'm unfortunately out of town. We have been dealing with ABC for decades and never had an issue until now. Very poor customer service on your part ,Other

"In 2018 I had a huge issue and confusion with invoices that were never mailed to me. In addition the accounts receivable department at ABC Boston kept applying my payments to the wrong invoices. At that time, I started paying my invoices thru the payment hub to make it easier for your accounts receivable department. I also emailed our account rep in July and told him that I was going to pay the invoices in question but would not pay any future invoices unless they were sent to me. Again in January I had invoices on my account that I never received. This happens often and it's frustrating. How do I even know they are mine? I should get an invoice every time there is a drop ship. I'm not sure why they aren't consistent in sending them. I received a reply from our rep that I felt was a bit unprofessional. As you can see by the history on my account I pay my invoices weekly. The invoices in question are for dates that are always the same amount and it is hard to track. As a customer I should be receiving an invoice for every drop ship I receive, I should not have to go in and pull my own invoices, which I do on many occasions. you, Ana",Statement

Theron is aware that I continue to receive a bill for this item as does his boss, the regional manager for this district (I fail to recall his name) If this is not resolved and if I receive another invoice for this item I will cease all business with Xyz until it is resolved.

" The three invoices you show as past due are credits that were applied to check number 74000 that was cut and mailed on 4/2/19. I have attached a copy of these credit memos to this e-mail for your reference.  I'm not sure why they would be showing as amounts due as they are credits in our system. We have had several problems recently where credits are being sent to us that we apply and use against other invoices, only later to be told that they are actually not credits.  In those cases we were never sent the original corresponding invoices.  I'm not sure if there is an issue with these credits and memos crossing in the mail, but our system applies any credits received to any existing open invoices that need to be paid.  In previous years, we have never had to apply credits to specific invoices. In this case, credit memo 261417349 references invoice 261410523 that was paid in full on 4/10 and credit memo 261420753 references invoice 261414460 that was also paid in full on 4/10, both with check number 74055.

Given that we had just in fact met on this past Tuesday, April 9th with yet another meeting scheduled for Wednesday, April 24th we reiterate the necessity for immediate clarification. Have the meetings, dialogue & account reviews we have been participating in with Xyz not been communicated between Xyz departments? Is Xyz not acknowledging that this dialogue has been occurring since December of 2018? Are we being told through the demand emails sent yesterday that Xyz no longer has any interest in resolving the relationship we had prior to our request for review of our accounts with Xyz? Is Xyz no longer interested in defining and correcting the acknowledged erroneous amounts on all of our accounts? you in advance for your attention to our accounts and prompt response to our request for clarification.Regards,Giuseppe & Marsha LoMedico",Other

"Kevin, On Wednesday 4/10/19 when your account was placed on hold it was due to short payments that are pending on the account but I have spoken to Lara and she has explained that those short payments are due to shorts you have received on your past deliveries from Xyz Nashville. This hold did not impact your delivery order for today since this order had already been cross dock with Xyz Nashville since Monday. Therefore, you will receive your delivery today. The hold was only going to impact you in being able to place a new order for today but since we were able to speak and explain to the credit department the issue, they removed your account off hold. We have also received your order for next week and it will get cross dock with Xyz Nashville this Monday 4/15 for a Friday delivery 4/19. In addition, Lara has confirmed that she placed the credit request for these short payments that are currently on your account but they are still pending because the finance department is requesting further back up. So in the meantime while I try to get this situation resolved with Xyz Nashville on them being able to start providing you with copies of your invoices and having the driver notate the shorts and damages can you email me within 24hrs of your delivery with any delivery discrepancies you may encounter? I understand that this has been a very frustrating situation and I want to ensure you that I am working on trying to get this resolved. If you have any further question or concerns feel free to reach out to me. Hope you have a great weekend and I hope to have some new updates by next week.",Other

"On 3/21 I issued and mailed 4 separate checks to Xyz Foods for 4 different hotel accounts. Two of the checks were posted, and two were not. The two accounts with past due for missing checks are Home2 811414 and Hampton Airport 697961. The difference between the four checks issued on 3/21, is that the 2 checks that did get posted were mailed to 7705 National Turnpike and the 2 unposted checks were mailed to PO Box 32470. There were checks issued for these 2 hotels on 3/15 and 3/28 which were posted that were mailed to the same PO Box address. I can believe one check getting lost in the mail, but find it hard to believe that 2 different hotel payments have vanished. My question to you is, can we submit a request to check your payment processing center for payments that might be hung up, misplaced, or misapplied somehow?

The invoices that were due were for the second half of the month so the second week of the month seems like it should be a timely manner..

"Lawrence Memorial Hospital has just completed a corporate reorganization to access additional funding.  The reorganization was effective January 1, 2019.  LMH is now a private not for profit organization.  CMS, (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services) is in the process of approving the reorganization.  We have no reason to believe this will not happen very soon.  More than ten other hospitals in Arkansas have reorganized in this manner during the last few years and all of these reorganizations were approved. It does take some time for CMS to process.  We believe the government shutdown slowed this process.  We expect approval any day.  However, we have not been able to bill for all services provided starting 1/1/2019 and are conserving cash until this approval is final.  We ask your patience while we work through this process.  call me at 870-886-1263 if you have any questions. 4/17/2019 UPDATE  We expect to begin receiving payments from CMS for services rendered beginning 1/1/19 during the week of April 22, 2019 and will begin the process of paying vendors for overdue invoices at that time.",Paid by Customer

"As I've mentioned before based on your research I still do not show WHICH invoice or invoices have not been paid. Every invoice every week was paid and all the way back to Dave we were told that I was current, every Damm week, than after we dispute the prices over the past 4 months of buying and were told we would receive credit, but never did.   The only tho g I know is that we have shown Xyz reps and even the Modesto center president those overcharged prices, overpriced items of over $8,000. So in summary we have not been shown specific invoices not paid and dates we have only been told we were current until such time that we brought up billing errors and overcharged prices. So I don't feel we are past due anywhere, I feel it is as YOUR sales associates had told me. ( you are current). And that we have overcharged credits due, and we were told would be credited, and have not been. Those overcharged again equal approx $8,000. All I've ever heard from Xyz is let's first clear up the amount you owe us and than we will discus the overcharged. I got s better idea let's first clear up overcharged, than show me which and where you show and why I owe, than I will clear those up. for listening.paul postma hamiltons Diner",Paid by Customer

"NidI apologize for the unfortunate circumstances we are in. be advised that LifeCare and certain of its affiliated entities filed for chapter 11 protection commencing on May 6, 2019 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Case No. 19-10998. Once a company files for bankruptcy, actions to collect against the debtor for claims that arose prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy case are prohibited by the automatic stay set forth in Bankruptcy Code section 362(a). Bankruptcy Code section 362(a)(6) provides that the stay prevents a creditor of the debtor from taking any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case. Furthermore, courts have found that the automatic stay as set forth in section 362(a)(6) extends to prohibit creditors or vendors of the debtor from refusing to provide future services unless the debtor repays claims that it owes to the creditor for services rendered prior to the bankruptcy filing date.

 Yes I pulled everything out last night after you sent me the invoices. I somehow did not change the last check so I paid $58.51 short on 252657648. And I have not been getting any invoices for a while now on my lease of the dish machine so I had added a payment of $115.95 for that. So I have noticed that I guess the lease has gone up. I have not been notified of that so I am short on invoice 252648451 $5.80 So I do need you to apply that payment to these 2 invoices and I will sent out a check for the balance of $64.31. I am not receiving invoices for my lease payment. I use to get an invoice via email. So that is why it is not getting paid on time. I need an invoice email or mailed to me for this . I am a working owner and there are days I cannot even get to my paperwork. So without a bill (invoice) I do not always remember.,Promised

"Explanation of Payment Delay: One of the items on that particular invoice order was ""out of stock"", and had to be re-ordered. The intent was to get all items and then pay the total due. That delivery invoice of $1,160.24 was paid online yesterday, as well as the re-order delivery invoice of $160.51, for a TOTAL of $1,320.75. The entire process of paying the total(s) was sidetracked when I was out of the office and after a fall that broke my elbow and injured my leg with a possible fracture. Late payment of the ""overdue"" amount (due on the 10th, paid on the 14th) was totally unintentional and semi-unavoidable. Henceforth, so that ""attempt(s) to collect a debt"" by Xyz will not be necessary in the future, I will make every attempt to promptly pay Xyz's invoices upon receipt.",Paid by Customer

"inbound.appriver.com rejected your message to the following email addresses: Your message couldn't be delivered. When Office 365 tried to send the message, the external email server returned the error below. This is probably due to a problem or policy setting on the recipient's email system. Check the error for information about the problem. The error might tell you what went wrong and how to fix it. For example, if it says the message was blocked due to a potential virus, try sending the message again without attachments. For Email Admins This error was reported by an email server outside Office 365, and if the sender is unable to fix the problem by modifying their message then it's likely that it's a problem that only the recipient's email admin can fix. Check the error for information about the problem. The error might tell you what went wrong and provide clues for how to fix it. For example, if it says the message was rejected due a Sender Policy Framework (SPF) issue then you'll have to work with your domain registrar to properly configure your SPF record. Check the error for information about where the problem is happening. For example, look for a domain name like contoso.com. This tells you which organization was responsible for the error. The recipient's email server could be causing the problem, or it could be due to a third-party service that your organization or the recipient's organization is using to process or filter email messages. If you can't fix the problem, contact the responsible party's email admin. This could be the recipient's email admin, your smart host service admin, or someone similar.

From talking to Elliot and others at Xyz I understand the A/R department was relocated from Mass to Texas at that time. I, and Elliot have attempted to escalate this but keep getting shifted to different people. Who can I talk with to get this fixed for all of our accounts? It is exceptionally frustrating as a customer to be promptly paying our invoices per agreed to terms and constantly be being told that we are overdue. This is a Xyz failure pure and simple. This needs to be fixed by Xyz now or we will be switching all our accounts to one of our other suppliers (US Food and PFG) used by more of our other locations. get back to me with the correct persons contact info.

"find attached copies of proof from bank showing the dates checked were cashed by Xyz on referenced invoices. Your invoice for $318.19 and $569.67 were paid together in amount of $887.86. This check was cashed by you on 4/26/19. Invoice # 296593568 in amount of $968.75 was also cashed on 5/10/19. As stated earlier our account needs 30 days credit term as you are always behind posting payments in spiteof having cashed checks days earlier. I really find this as very annoying and waste of time dealing with calls to collect and harassing us in front of staff. I do not see any other solution other than changing credit terms or get your efficiency up, which I do see happening.",Paid by Customer

Aside from the first two amounts (3 days) in which a check has been sent , like we always do, these overdue amounts dating all the way back to October 2018 are still pending credits from Xyz for returned subpar and damaged foods.. We have been patiently waiting for these credits to happen. We have been trying to balance our books and cannot do so without them being taken care of. To send out an email with these included is not only ridiculous but also shows a lack of customer service.

"Don't know why you show an open balance for this invoice. Item #10 which is where you think I owe you money is the same exact part as item #4. Why TTI charges me $0.326 for a partial of the quantity I ordered and $3.55 for the balance is beyond me. I spoke with Luke about this back in January.  He said it was a mistake and was supposed to have removed this from the order. Tom wasn't in the office that day. Far as I'm concerned, this order is closed and paid in full.

There is no AP action needed. Attached find the Raytheon Supplier Activity Report.  Payment status of current invoices and estimated due dates are available on the Supplier Invoice Status report that is emailed on daily basis.  We have verified nora.morales@ttiinc.com and kim.villarreal@ttiinc.com are signed up to receive the invoice history report which contains your invoices in our main AP system. If we need to update the profile by removing one of them and adding you, let us know. Accounts Payable no longer researches invoices that are less than 15 days past due. Invoice due dates are only estimates.  Invoices pay the Tuesday after the due date. If you have questions about the status of invoices on your report, forward the report to aphelp@raytheon.com with your comments.  If your invoices are not on the report, state in the email that you have reviewed the report and the invoices you are inquiring about are not on the report. If your purchase order states the PO is ERS (Electronic Receipt Settlement), you will not see anything on the report until the goods have been received in our system and the payment is generated from the goods receipt report. Due to the fact that payment is generated at material receipt, it will often reference something other than your invoice number. If goods have been shipped and you do not see a transaction listed for the PO, contact your buyer for status of the goods receipt. I am also sending you a separate email with instruction on how to access your invoices through the Raytheon Portal.

" Due to the shelter in place order issued by the Illinois Governor's office our Accounts Payable department is not able to issue checks at this time.   The order is in place until at least April 30th however it is our intent to pay our vendors as soon as possible by converting from check to ACH. We are asking for your cooperation in completing the attached ACH payment document in-full, signed  and returned to us at your earliest convenience. note, we are not requiring a voided check so disregard that request. Due to our internal controls we cannot accept a simple PDF copy of your bank information as ""this document"" shall be competed in-full by the vendor.  If we don't receive the attached document as requested it may delay your payment. There will be a confirmation step that is required for every vendor converting from check to ACH.  This is to mitigate fraud and you will receive a random small dollar amount in your account which will need to be confirmed before we send full payment.",Other
"Jeannette, you for reaching out to us. I have escalated your concern to the appropriate department, rest assured we will update you of its progress no later than 3 business days from today. refrain from creating another ticket by sending a new email inquiry to AP@DTNAHelpdesk or to any DTNA department, as this duplicates efforts and can delay the process. We appreciate your patience. For future reference, note that the status of your invoice, debit memo copies (except Warranty and Aftermarket Debit Memos), remittance advice copies and ERS document copies are available on the portal at https://p2pp.sourcehov.com/dtna/. Invoices will show on the portal depending on the mode of submission below after they are submitted by you. PDF/email: 7-10 business days EDI: 5-7 business days To register, email APWebportal@Daimler.com with the vendor code/s you require to see in the supplier portal, email address and company name for the request to be completed. note that your vendor code is reflected on the remittance advice and debit memo copies. you and have a great day!",Promised

We will verify the content of this e-mail, and if a proper invoice was attached and all relevant information is matching to TEs Purchasing Document, a release for payment will be made within the agreed terms. To ensure automated and fast invoice processing in TEs systems, the following requirements must be met: Invoice requirements: o   print the correct Bill-to address on your invoice  see table below o   A valid and matching TE Purchasing Document Number must be mentioned on all Invoice documents submitted (for nonPO: TE Requester) o   send each invoice only once. Multiple submission of the same invoice will create payment delays o   Once you have started to apply the invoice submission by E-Mail, stop sending hard copy invoices by postal mail or any other method Mail requirements: o   Choose the corresponding E-Mail Address depending on the ordering TE Entity  see table below o   The total size of the E-Mail cannot exceed 7 MB o   The correct E-Mail Address for your Invoice is mentioned as well on the Purchasing Document (PO) PDF requirements: o   Readable PDFs are preferred and in your interest as TEs OCR provides better results which accelerates the process o   Each E-Mail message can contain multiple PDF files o   Each PDF file can only include one invoice. If one PDF file includes more than one invoice, it will not be accepted for processing o   The first PDF page must always be the Invoice, not e.g. T&Cs, packing list, shipping instruction form, delivery note. Best way to include such documents is to scan them behind the original invoice o   Make sure that your PDF invoice does not contain an empty page, this stops the scanning process Payment status  Vendor self-service: o   Check your payment status in TEs Supplier Portal (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__supplier.te.com&d=DwIF-g&c=03vu6jtmBLnSLFHPW7mKsg&r=aG7akD9oqbxtcStC-bTGnSXcuy1nvHYoRfLJ3maKouU&m=tkVX1aystWoin75JsZOgkkPqz2Et4bvh_efMSxl_3gY&s=sihRrW2flKN9phwUBxuIXEl0GiN1nqczsEc4FuhX3P4&e= <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__supplier.te.com_&d=DwIF-g&c=03vu6jtmBLnSLFHPW7mKsg&r=aG7akD9oqbxtcStC-bTGnSXcuy1nvHYoRfLJ3maKouU&m=tkVX1aystWoin75JsZOgkkPqz2Et4bvh_efMSxl_3gY&s=F-R3SffenGAvDwA30fy1A3pHyM9-kHdFzM3oeaZimJw&e= >) - Check Invoice Status application o   For other payment related questions find below in column Support the Service E-Mail and Phone Number to contact TEs AP department The PDF/E-Mail process is TEs preferred way to receive invoices.

"Sirs: The Governor of California, on Thursday evening, issued a statewide mandatory stay-at-home order to help combat the spread of the coronavirus. The order, which took effect Thursday night, requires the closure of many California businesses during this time period. It will remain in place until further notice. In compliance with this order, WET is prohibited from operating most of our regular business and manufacturing activities. This, of course, delays our shipping of product, and our subsequent receipt of payments from our clients and customers. We regret that this will delay us in making payments to you on our account with you. We have a very strong backlog of work awaiting us from our clients and customers; as soon as this ban on working has been lifted, we will resume full activities, and make payments to you as soon as we can thereafter. We appreciate our relationship with your company, and your patience as the State of California works through this issue. We will be contacting you when our headquarters resumes in-office work. Until then, stay safe and healthy,  and look forward to reaching out soon. Sincerely, WET Mark Fuller Mark W. Fuller CEO",Other

We will verify the content of this e-mail, and if a proper invoice was attached and all relevant information is matching to TEs Purchasing Document, a release for payment will be made within the agreed terms. To ensure automated and fast invoice processing in TEs systems, the following requirements must be met: Invoice requirements: o   print the correct Bill-to address on your invoice  see table below o   A valid and matching TE Purchasing Document Number must be mentioned on all Invoice documents submitted (for nonPO: TE Requester) o   send each invoice only once. Multiple submission of the same invoice will create payment delays o   Once you have started to apply the invoice submission by E-Mail, stop sending hard copy invoices by postal mail or any other method Mail requirements: o   Choose the corresponding E-Mail Address depending on the ordering TE Entity  see table below o   The total size of the E-Mail cannot exceed 7 MB o   The correct E-Mail Address for your Invoice is mentioned as well on the Purchasing Document (PO) PDF requirements: o   Readable PDFs are preferred and in your interest as TEs OCR provides better results which accelerates the process o   Each E-Mail message can contain multiple PDF files o   Each PDF file can only include one invoice. If one PDF file includes more than one invoice, it will not be accepted for processing o   The first PDF page must always be the Invoice, not e.g. T&Cs, packing list, shipping instruction form, delivery note. Best way to include such documents is to scan them behind the original invoice o   Make sure that your PDF invoice does not contain an empty page, this stops the scanning process Payment status  Vendor self-service: o   Check your payment status in TEs Supplier Portal (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__supplier.te.com&d=DwIF-g&c=03vu6jtmBLnSLFHPW7mKsg&r=aG7akD9oqbxtcStC-bTGnSXcuy1nvHYoRfLJ3maKouU&m=1-WavJaoz9u1milDqTcxr2JRYDimLMQC4TTJb39eE0w&s=PILhmvD5hQgJep7ol_UWo-FkRyvmH_yeAm6fa3qRjjg&e= <https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__supplier.te.com_&d=DwIF-g&c=03vu6jtmBLnSLFHPW7mKsg&r=aG7akD9oqbxtcStC-bTGnSXcuy1nvHYoRfLJ3maKouU&m=1-WavJaoz9u1milDqTcxr2JRYDimLMQC4TTJb39eE0w&s=PycPaRjGent0oih7TGRQBNy6jlsFLa0QzrfAjV_Qo2A&e= >) - Check Invoice Status application o   For other payment related questions find below in column Support the Service E-Mail and Phone Number to contact TEs AP department The PDF/E-Mail process is TEs preferred way to receive invoices.

" The 5.52 was paid on 2-27-2020, by ACH. The others are in the system. With the COVID 19 things have changed here,  layoffs, and all but 10 employees in middle of 4 week furlough, and the 10 are working from home. It takes 8 Employees to pull off a payment run and some of those (2) have to be Non Accounting, so for it to take place as normal is out of the question at this time. So with Corporate in charge of our payment runs now, I await info from them as to when and who.  check back next Thursday, and hopefully I will have new information. Apologize for the inconvenience.

Summary of your Request Response: Attached find the Raytheon Supplier Activity Report.  Payment status of current invoices and estimated due dates are available on the Supplier Invoice Status report that is emailed on daily basis.  We have verified nora.morales@ttiinc.com and  kim.villarreal@ttiinc.com are signed up to receive the invoice history report which contains your invoices in our main AP system. If we need to update the profile by removing one of them and adding you, let us know. Accounts Payable no longer researches invoices that are less than 15 days past due. Invoice due dates are only estimates.  Invoices pay the Tuesday after the due date. If you have questions about the status of invoices on your report, forward the report to aphelp@raytheon.com with your comments.  If your invoices are not on the report, state in the email that you have reviewed the report and the invoices you are inquiring about are not on the report. If your purchase order states the PO is ERS (Electronic Receipt Settlement), you will not see anything on the report until the goods have been received in our system and the payment is generated from the goods receipt report. Due to the fact that payment is generated at material receipt, it will often reference something other than your invoice number. If goods have been shipped and you do not see a transaction listed for the PO, contact your buyer for status of the goods receipt. I am also sending you a separate email with instruction on how to access your invoices through the Raytheon Portal.

"call me so we can straighten this out. We have just received the 25 of each of the 4 connectors yesterday, Monday. We have received 3 invoices. There was to be 4 staggered deliveries of 25 of each connector. The first invoice showed $925.97 for 25 connectors, but the quote was approx. $1500 for 100 of each connector. This would indicate we have received 60% of whats been ordered. Then we had individual invoice for partial connector pieces. So the math doesnt make sense to me.

If you have questions about the status of invoices on your report, forward the report to aphelp@raytheon.com with your comments.  If your invoices are not on the report, state in the email that you have reviewed the report and the invoices you are inquiring about are not on the report. If your purchase order states the PO is ERS (Electronic Receipt Settlement), you will not see anything on the report until the goods have been received in our system and the payment is generated from the goods receipt report. Due to the fact that payment is generated at material receipt, it will often reference something other than your invoice number. If goods have been shipped and you do not see a transaction listed for the PO, contact your buyer for status of the goods receipt.

"Sanmina has provided a secure, web-based  *iSupplier Finance Portal* free of charge for our suppliers. You will need to utilize the portal to obtain status of your invoices and remittance information. The Portal allows you immediate access to current agings with estimated payment dates, any invoice on hold issues you need to be aware of, as well as recent and historical payment details. The portal also gives you Buyer contact information in case you need that information to resolve any hold issues. The portal also provides a *Service Request tool, *which is the mechanism by which to contact Accounts Payable for any invoice or payment inquiries. AP strives to address and resolve all Service Requests as promptly as possible. This system has replaced the need to email specific AP personnel and allows any AP person to access the information when necessary. Since Sanmina Corporation has provided the tools to allow all suppliers to manage their account access, all communication with AP should be *via the supplier portal*. Accounts Payable no longer monitors emails on a daily basis. Emails to AP personnel can only be addressed after all of the Service Requests are resolved. We strongly suggest all supplier contact be via the iSupplier Portal and Service Request systems. If you are not already enrolled, contact our Portal Administrator at external.portal@sanmina.com for enrollment assistance. Someone from our AP HelpDesk will email you with all of the necessary information when your user name has been created. *Also note:*  be aware that the following emails are unable to provide AP assistance: *ssc.operator@sanmina.com*email address is for invoice submissions via individual pdf files only. *external.portal@sanmina.com*email address is for portal enrollment and technical issues only. *info@sanmina.com*email address is for Investor Relations inquiries only.",Auto Reply

"Sanmina has provided a secure, web-based  *iSupplier Finance Portal* free of charge for our suppliers. You will need to utilize the portal to obtain status of your invoices and remittance information. The Portal allows you immediate access to current agings with estimated payment dates, any invoice on hold issues you need to be aware of, as well as recent and historical payment details. The portal also gives you Buyer contact information in case you need that information to resolve any hold issues. The portal also provides a *Service Request tool, *which is the mechanism by which to contact Accounts Payable for any invoice or payment inquiries. AP strives to address and resolve all Service Requests as promptly as possible. This system has replaced the need to email specific AP personnel and allows any AP person to access the information when necessary.
